## Predicting neurologic injuries among pediatric EMCO patients  
In this project, a predictive computational model will be created that uses comprehensive physiological and laboratory data to identify risk factors for neurologic injury among pediatric patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECM)O and uses these factors to predict outcomes for these patients.
